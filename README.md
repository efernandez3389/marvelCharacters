# README #

We have decided to build the app under a clean+MVVM architecture. This way, we have separated the code into three different layers: 
* Domain (business logic)
* Data (data repository)
* Presentation (UI layer using MVVM)

We 've also using different frameworks to help us during the development: 
* Alamofire (http requests)
* RxSwift (binding between view controllers and view models)
* SDWebImage (manage and downloads images)
* SwiftLint (code style)


### TO DO / IMPROVEMENTS ###
* Add Unit Tests
* Add UI Tests
* Add Snapshot testing
* Add sonarqube for code review
